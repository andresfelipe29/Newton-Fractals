# Newton-Fractals

C++ implementation using Newton's Method to plot a ppm format image of a Newton's fractal.

The fractals are generated by studying the convergence velocity of Newton's method when finding the roots of a complex function. The grey scale on the images shows how fast the algorithm found one root of the function, the darker a point is, the longer it took to find a root starting from that point in the complex plain.
